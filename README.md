# Jihadi John's (Emwazi) Final Day 

In late Nov 12, 2015 (local time in Raqqa), coalition ISR tracked Mohammed Emwazi (“Jihadi John”) as he left a building and entered a car. A precision strike—carried out using MQ-9 Reaper drones—hit the vehicle on/near central Raqqa roads. Officials described it as a clean hit with no reported civilian casualties. Islamic State later confirmed his death in its magazine, publishing unmasked photos posthumously. 

Years before he became the face of IS hostage videos, Emwazi’s path was comparatively ordinary: a **BSc in Information Systems & Business Management (2009)** from the University of Westminster, attempts to build a life and work in **Kuwait**, and a **2009 Tanzania** detention/deportation episode that drew security‑service attention. The “**Beatles**” nickname that made him infamous did not originate with journalists—it was coined by **hostages** to distinguish the four Britons guarding them.

## Not Well Known Facts

| Fact | Why it’s noteworthy |
|---|---|
| The “Beatles” nickname was coined by **hostages**, not by the media. | Clarifies origin often misattributed to journalists. |
| IS publicly **confirmed his death** weeks later, publishing unmasked photos. | Many summaries end at the strike; the formal confirmation came after. |
| The strike used **MQ‑9 Reaper** drones firing a **Hellfire** at the vehicle. | Platform/munition details are often omitted in quick recaps. |
| Emwazi’s degree: **Information Systems & Business Management (2009)**. | His training was in computing/business, not religious studies. |
| **2009 Tanzania** detention/deportation and questioning in transit. | A lesser‑known prelude that fed later counter‑terror interest. |
| Repeated attempts to **base in Kuwait** (job/wedding plans) were blocked. | Shows a more everyday life track before Syria. |
| His **mother reportedly recognized his voice** in the early videos. | Specific early clue prior to public naming. |
| Post‑revelation, **University of Westminster** tightened event policies. | Illustrates institutional ripples in the UK. |
| Advocacy group **CAGE** alleged MI5 harassment contributed to radicalization—**a disputed claim**. | Context that’s frequently reduced to headlines; not consensus. |

Where accounts diverge (e.g., exact street, minutes‑level timing), the visuals show an **uncertainty ring** and label things as “reported.”

## Notes & context
- The U.S. DOJ later prosecuted members of the ISIS “Beatles” cell for a hostage-taking scheme that resulted in the deaths of four Americans (Foley, Sotloff, Kassig, Kayla Mueller) and other foreign nationals. Mueller died in ISIS custody but was **not** killed in an Emwazi beheading video.
- Dates above are public release/confirmation dates; the precise moment/location of death may differ.
